A health-care issue that has been in the news lately is the computerization of health records. This possibility is being approached cautiously because of sensitive privacy and security concerns, among others.
Computerizing health records could make it easier for patients to share their health profiles and histories among their various health-care professionals. This could improve the quality of health care, help avoid drug conflicts and erroneous drug prescriptions, reduce costs and, in emergencies, could save lives.
In this project, I have designed a "starter" Heal thProfile class for a person. 
The class attributes includes the person's first name, last name, gender, date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth), height (in inches) and weight (in pounds).
HealthProfile class has a constructor that receives this data. For each attribute, provide set and get functions.
The class also includes member functions that calculate and return the user's age in years, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range, and body mass index (BMI). 
This program prompts for the person's information, instantiates an object of class HealthProfile for that person and prints the information from that object-including the person's first name, last name, gender, date of birth, height and weight-then calculates and prints the person's age in years, BMI, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range. 
It also displays the BMI values chart at the end.
